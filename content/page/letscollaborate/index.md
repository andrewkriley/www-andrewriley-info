I love being exposed to new paradigms and inspire others to experiment alongside me. “Imagine If…. What if we….. If you could…..” 

I like to discover a myriad of ways to approach a challenge, and I have the energy to explore them all because I want to learn as much as possible from the process. I believe our greatest ideas come at the intersection of our experiences.

If you think I could make a difference to your organisation or project please get in touch.
