[{"content":"TLDR; What is Hugo https://gohugo.io/ - \u0026ldquo;The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the high level steps\nDownload Hugo binary for your OS Confirm you can run the hugo binary Create a new site using hugo Initiate a new git repository inside your newly provisioned hugo site Push your new site to github.com Connect your Github to CloudFlare Pages Deploy your hugo site to CloudFlare Pages Did I try using Docker?\nYes, Docker is the default answer to everything right? I discovered permission issues with the base setup when running hugo new site \u0026lt;newsite\u0026gt;, mounting the path as a volume and then trying to edit it in Visual Studio Code. Am sure there\u0026rsquo;s a way around this but for these first steps I just wanted a result. Hence the above approach using the locally run Hugo binary on my dev workstation meant permissions where simple and I could get underway quickly.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the detail 1 2 3 andreril ~/Downloads/hugo_extended_0.145.0_darwin-universal $ ./hugo version hugo v0.145.0-666444f0a52132f9fec9f71cf25b441cc6a4f355+extended darwin/arm64 BuildDate=2025-02-26T15:41:25Z VendorInfo=gohugoio andreril ~/Downloads/hugo_extended_0.145.0_darwin-universal $ run the binary to create a new site 1 hugo new site my-first-site You should see the following output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Congratulations! Your new Hugo site was created in /Users/andreril/Desktop/dev/my-first-site. Just a few more steps... 1. Change the current directory to /Users/andreril/Desktop/dev/my-first-site. 2. Create or install a theme: - Create a new theme with the command \u0026#34;hugo new theme \u0026lt;THEMENAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; - Or, install a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ 3.
